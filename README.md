# Introduction to Python
Here you can find all materials for the intro to python course.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can find an introduction [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).
However, git will be no part of the course and will only serve as a hosting platform for all materials.
We will be talking about the GitHub repository and it's structure in the first session as well.
For now you can directly download the materials for the first session [here](https://github.com/MisterXY89/intro-to-python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

For every session there are two notebooks - one script and one containing the exercises. 
The script for session 1 can be found here:
